The goal of the project is to improve user experience. The JavaScript code in this project creates pagination buttons so the user can properly navigate the webpage. There is also a search bar to help users find a student in the list. If the user's browser doesn't allow JavaScript, the list will still be displayed in the browser and will still function normally. Only it wouldn't include the extra features such as the pagination buttons and search bar.
